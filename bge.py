"""This is the Battleship Game Engine.

This module contains the components required to run a game of Battleship.

2-player usage:

>>> game = Game()
>>>
>>> grid = game.create_grid('John')
>>> grid.add_ship(destroyer, ('A', 1), ('A', 2))
>>> grid.add_ship(submarine, ('D', 9), ('E', 9), ('F', 9))
>>> grid.add_ship(cruiser, ('J', 8), ('J', 9), ('J', 10))
>>> grid.add_ship(battleship, ('F', 3), ('G', 3), ('H', 3), ('I', 3))
>>> grid.add_ship(carrier, ('C', 2), ('C', 3), ('C', 4), ('C', 5), ('C', 6))
>>>
>>> grid = game.create_grid('Jane')
>>> grid.add_ship(destroyer, ('B', 2), ('B', 3))
>>> grid.add_ship(submarine, ('B', 6), ('C', 6), ('D', 6))
>>> grid.add_ship(cruiser, ('F', 1), ('G', 1), ('H', 1))

>>> hit
False
